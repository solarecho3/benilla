//! The avatar, the camera and their input: free-fly until the server places us, then third-person
//! control of our body, a kinematic capsule over avian's `MoveAndSlide`, streamed to the server as
//! the active mover. The cursor is [`crate::cursor`]'s; this module only hides it for mouselook.
//!
//! As in 1.12, right-drag turns the character, left-drag orbits the camera, both buttons run
//! forward steering like a right-drag, and the wheel zooms within `cameraDistanceMax`; the
//! auto-follow (`cameraSmoothStyle`, [`camera::FollowStyle`]) reels a left-drag orbit back in. The
//! dev chord with `F` toggles free-fly, and with `G` lands the avatar at the camera ([`land`]).
//!
//! This file holds the plugin and its ordering edges, the types the modules beside it share
//! ([`Player`], [`BodyQuery`], [`TransportQuery`], [`StandStateRequest`]) and the
//! `UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS` bits with several readers; the per-frame system is [`controller::control`].
