//! The celestial layer over the sky dome: the sun and white moon (each a disc and an additive
//! glare), moon02 and the `Stars.m2` stars. The reference's setup `0x6d1ba0` builds the six
//! bodies, the builder `0x6d3b80` places each at `cam + 12·dir`, `CSky::Render` (`0x6d4940`) draws
//! stars, sun, white moon and moon02 in a far depth slice without depth writes, and every disc
//! takes the horizon clip and fade `0x6d1960`. One broadcast celestial diffuse (`[0xce9c2c]`,
//! LightIntBand sub-9, alpha 0xFF) tints every disc and glare but moon02, which has no colour
//! writer; the white moon's teal rim is the dome's night bands (sub-3..6) through its feathered
//! edge. Every body takes the sky's far-depth pin. The bodies are placed in plain world space, so
//! they project through the world camera's aspect-derived fovy (44.1° at 16:9, Hor+ on ultrawide).
